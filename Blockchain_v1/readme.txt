Create a simple blockchain in Rust. This is a more complex program that demonstrates some fundamental blockchain concepts, such as creating blocks, hashing, and validating the chain.

1. Add dependencies to Cargo.toml
2. Import necessary libraries
3. Define the Block and Blockchain structs
4. Implement methods for creating new blocks and hashing
5. Implement methods for creating a new blockchain and adding blocks
6. Implement methods for validating the chain
7. Test the blockchain in the main function

This  demonstrates a simple blockchain in Rust. The program defines Block and Blockchain structs, implements methods for creating new blocks, hashing, creating a new blockchain, adding blocks, and validating the chain.

The main function creates a new blockchain, adds a few blocks to it, and validates the chain. It also shows an example of tampering with the data in the chain and re-validating the tampered chain, which should result in an invalid blockchain.
