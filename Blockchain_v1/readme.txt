Simple blockchain (v1) in Rust. This is an illustration of a straightforward blockchain built in Rust. It is a slightly intricate program exhibiting some basic blockchain concepts, such as formation of blocks, hashing, and verification of the chain.

The steps are as follows:

1. Add necessary dependencies to the Cargo.toml file
2. Incorporate the required libraries
3. Formulate the Block and Blockchain structures
4. Develop methods for producing new blocks and hashing
5. Develop methods to construct a new blockchain and append blocks
6. Establish methods to authenticate the chain
7. Experiment with the blockchain within the main function

This portrayal exhibits a rudimentary blockchain in Rust, with definitions of Block and Blockchain structures and implementation of methods for generating new blocks, hashing, initiating a new blockchain, appending blocks, and confirming the chain's integrity.

The main function initiates a fresh blockchain, inserts several blocks into it, and confirms the chain's validity. It also provides an instance of data manipulation within the chain and re-validation of the manipulated chain, resulting in an invalidated blockchain.
